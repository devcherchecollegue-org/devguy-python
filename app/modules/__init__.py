"""
Inner services containing devguy specific business logics
and implementations.

A domain should only contain code related to it and have a public API.
Any method that should not be used outside or it should be indicated as private
(if a class is specific to domains, add _ before the name to indicate it should
not be used outside except for testing).

If you need to mock a class for testing, it is better to define an abstract
class on it to ensure mock class will comply to definition.
